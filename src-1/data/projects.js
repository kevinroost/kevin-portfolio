    description: "My first project as a developer, this is a simple recreation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe, using JS with a dash of CSS and HTML. The program takes in each player's name and addresses them throughout, all the way up to announcing the winner.",

    title: "Boss Battles",
    description: "Boss Battles is a text based battle simulator that pits players against 5 different enemies, gathering loot along the way. After the player chooses one of three classes, each with unique starting stats, they come face-to-face with their first opponent. Once defeated, the boss drops loot that the player will choose from, boosting stats and setting up the player for the next battle. Victory comes when all 5 bosses are defeated!",

    description: "Finally! An app that lets you and your friends get together and create a fantasy league... for Ru Paul's Drag Race! After all the queens have been introduced, any number of people can join and draft a team of 5 queens. As the episodes air, each queen's total points will go up (or down!) depending on her performance in the episode. Users can even suggest additional ways to earn points, but only before the teams are finalized.",

    title: "CAST",
    description: "This app was born out of a desire to optimize a very manual casting process. Instead of sifting through resumes one by one, Cast allows Talent to setup a profile and have Casting Directors reach out to them. It's more simple, streamined, and modern.",

Something needs to happen. ShelterBy can help. We give an alternate solution to sending a furry friend to a shelter or off as a stray.",
