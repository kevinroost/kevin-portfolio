    discription: "**STILL IN DEVELOPMENT** Boss Battles is a text based battle simulator that pits players against 5 different enemies, gathering loot along the way. After the player chooses one of three classes, each with unique starting stats, they come face-to-face with their first opponent. Once defeated, the boss drops 3 pieces of equipment that the player will choose from. Each piece of equipment will boost certain stats upon pick-up, setting up the player for the next battle. Victory comes when all 5 bosses are defeated!",

After all the queens have been introduced, in the case of this season, after episode 2, any number of people can join and draft a team of 5 queens. As the episodes air, each queen's total points will go up (or down!) depending on her performance in the episode. Users can even suggest additional ways to earn points, but only before the teams are finalized.",
