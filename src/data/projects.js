    title: "Tic-Tac-Toe",
    description: "My first project as a developer, this is a simple recreation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe, using JS with a dash of CSS and HTML. The program takes in each player's name and addresses them throughout, all the way up to announcing the winner.",

    title: "Boss Battles",
    description: "Boss Battles is a text based battle simulator that pits players against 5 different enemies, gathering loot along the way. After the player chooses one of three classes, each with unique starting stats, they come face-to-face with their first opponent. Once defeated, the boss drops 3 pieces of equipment that the player will choose from. Each piece of equipment will boost certain stats upon pick-up, setting up the player for the next battle. Victory comes when all 5 bosses are defeated!",

    description: "Finally! An app that lets you and your friends get together and create a fantasy league... for Ru Paul's Drag Race! After all the queens have been introduced, in the case of this season, after episode 2, any number of people can join and draft a team of 5 queens. As the episodes air, each queen's total points will go up (or down!) depending on her performance in the episode. Users can even suggest additional ways to earn points, but only before the teams are finalized.",

    title: "CAST",
    description: "This app was born out of a desire to optimize a very manual casting process. Instead of sifting through resumes one by one, Cast allows Talent to setup a profile and have Casting Directors reach out to them. It's more simple, streamined, and modern.",

    title: "ShelterBy",
    description: "Especially during the pandemic- families have been home more and thus feel more available for a furry friend. However, people are suddenly unable to care for their pets, whether because they have returned to work in person and are unavailable, or they have not been able to work and funds have dried up. What does this mean? These new pets can't stick around. Something needs to happen. This causes an influx of animals at shelters or worse: in the wild. ShelterBy can help. We give an alternate to sending a furry friend to a shelter or off as a stray.",
