        My journey so far has been a wild ride. I’ve been a theater maker for most of my life. (Still am!) I started out as an actor, then eventually a teacher/choreographer, and recently a director/producer. This unique industry demands teamwork, cultivates camaraderie, and tests problem-solving on the fly. Theater has always been and always will be my biggest passion. 

        Simultaneously, I used to serve and bartend. While I was always ready to leave the service industry, I do appreciate that it shares much of the list of necessary skills with theater; namely dealing with people and quick problem solving.  

        Come 2020, I had an excuse to leave the service industry and find a different way to channel those skills. It took some time, but I finally discovered a way to do this AND lean into my strength in math and logic- coding! I took the dive and graduated from the immersive bootcamp with General Assembly, during which I got hands on experience with React, Express, JS, HTML, CSS, and more. My ongoing goal is to apply the seemingly unrelated strengths and skills I have cultivated throughout my life to my daily coding endeavors. I can finally say I’m thoroughly enjoying what I do everyday, whether it is in theater or tech!
